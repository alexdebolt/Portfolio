          <p>I am a passionate outdoorsman who has a climbing addiction. I studied nuclear engineering in school and worked in that field for a year before deciding to pursue self-employment through trading digital currencies. Due to market volatility and this venture no longer proved to be sustainable. This led me to start an E-commerce clothing company with my best friend who is an adept graphic desinger. Through this I learned the difficulties and lessons learned through starting your own business. My passion for travel has led me to pursue self-employment that could be done online for the past few years. Unfortunately I had to put my side project on hold until I regained fulltime employment. This led me to Codecademy where I began to learn Web Development. I learned(and still am learning) several languages and helped polish up my old programming skills from engineering. That leads me to right now where I am currently seeking remote employment so that I can build great things with companies and be able to travel as I please while also working on my side hustle.</p>
